    description:
      "You rarely use ‚Äòpreppy‚Äô and ‚Äòstreetwear‚Äô in the same sentence ‚Äì except when talking about Polo Ralph Lauren. From classic button-down shirts and embroidered polos to one-off capsules that are the envy of hypebeasts, Polo Ralph Lauren is in a league of its own. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre psyched to announce we‚Äôve teamed up with the iconic brand for an exclusive collab that mixes PRL‚Äôs signature heritage style with 90s influences and lots of color.",

    product: "HOW TO CUSTOMISE OLD DENIM",
    description:
      "With more of us doing those clear-outs we never usually have the time to do, you might have stumbled across a few old pairs of jeans that you‚Äôre just not that into anymore. Well, in the name of sustainability and creativity, why not turn your old denim into something fresh by customising it? But before you grab all the necessary bits and go all ‚Äòart club‚Äô on us, watch this video from our Insider down under, ASOS Jono. He‚Äôs already customised a pair with some very 2000s-inspired flame decals (that we‚Äôre 100% into), and he‚Äôs created a step-by-step vid on how to do the same. Of course, you don‚Äôt have to copy Jono‚Äôs 2000s-inspired flame decals but‚Ä¶ why wouldn‚Äôt you?",

      "Remember travel plans? Remember getting excited for vacations? Us neither. This year, we‚Äôre all about virtual music fests ‚úàÔ∏è trips to the garden ‚úàÔ∏è and quaran-tanning from home.
